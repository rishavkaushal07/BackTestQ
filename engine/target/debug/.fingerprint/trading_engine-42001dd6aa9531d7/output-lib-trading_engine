{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"call to unsafe function `pyo3::impl_::pymethods::BoundRef::<'a, 'py, pyo3::PyAny>::ref_from_ptr` is unsafe and requires unsafe block","code":{"code":"E0133","explanation":"Unsafe code was used outside of an unsafe block.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0133\nunsafe fn f() { return; } // This is the unsafe code\n\nfn main() {\n    f(); // error: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block\n}\n```\n\nUsing unsafe functionality is potentially dangerous and disallowed by safety\nchecks. Examples:\n\n* Dereferencing raw pointers\n* Calling functions via FFI\n* Calling functions marked unsafe\n\nThese safety checks can be relaxed for a section of the code by wrapping the\nunsafe instructions with an `unsafe` block. For instance:\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nfn main() {\n    unsafe { f(); } // ok!\n}\n```\n\nSee the [unsafe section][unsafe-section] of the Book for more details.\n\n#### Unsafe code in functions\n\nUnsafe code is currently accepted in unsafe functions, but that is being phased\nout in favor of requiring unsafe blocks here too.\n\n```\nunsafe fn f() { return; }\n\nunsafe fn g() {\n    f(); // Is accepted, but no longer recommended\n    unsafe { f(); } // Recommended way to write this\n}\n```\n\nLinting against this is controlled via the `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` lint, which\nis `warn` by default in the 2024 edition and `allow` by default in earlier\neditions.\n\n[unsafe-section]:
